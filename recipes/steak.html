    <h2>How to make Steak</h2>

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This recipe involves a steak being cooked in the reverse-sear method. This method is not for those who want a quick steak but for those who want to retain as much juices as possible in the steak. Easy to follow recipe!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 inch to 2 inch steak (I prefer Ribeye or New York Strip)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>High-smoke point oil</li>
        <li>Patience</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Equipment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oven</li>
        <li>Heavy pan, cast iron or stainless steel skillet works best</li>
        <li>Stove</li>
        <li>Tongs</li>
        <li>Baking sheet with wire rack</li>
        <li>Thermometer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 275° F</li>
        <li>Pat dry steak with paper towels</li>
        <li>Generously season steak with seasonings on all sides</li>
        <li>Let steak sit for at least 40 minutes at room temperature. </li>
        (Optional: Let steak brine overnight uncovered in fridge for maximum flavor.)
        <li>Place steak on baking sheet with wire rack and then place in oven</li>
        <li>Check on the steak's temperature in 15 minute intervals until the 
            temperature in the center reaches 10-15° F under your desired doneness.
        </li>
        (I take it out at 115° F for Medium Rare)
        <li>Heat up pan on high heat and add oil once smoking</li>
        <li>Take baking sheet out of oven and immediately place steak in pan.</li>
        <li>Take steak out once crust is developed on both sides and ideal internal
            temperature is reached
        </li>
        <li>No need to rest your steak if using this method so cut into your steak and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
